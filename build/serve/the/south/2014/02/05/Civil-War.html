<h2>civil war</h2>

<p>Yesterday I heard a history of the Civil War, the part you won&#39;t find in history books, because the winners write history. This was followed by a Hitler - Lincoln comparison (winners write the books - what would&#39;ve happened if Hitler won?), and then a promise that this current health care thing is going to go away once Obama is out of office.  I could feel the tension in the air, and I have a feeling the person I was talking to was also secretly stock piling arms for when the next Civil War breaks out.</p>

          <h2>Rails 4 Tutorial with Devise and Omniauth</h2>
<p class="meta">07 Feb 2014</p>

<div class="post">
<p>I&#39;m going to run you through this very basic setup for a start Rails
app.  It features Rails 4.1 and user authentication with Devise and Omniauth. Devise handles many things related to creating user accounts within rails and is modular,  so you only include what you need. There&#39;s many plugins to allow Devise to do fancy things like work with invitations.  Omniauth is used to provide oauth with a 3rd party oauth provider, like Facebook or Soundcloud.</p>

<p>First things first: make sure you are using rbenv or rvm. I&#39;m partial to
rvm. </p>

<p><code>rvm list rubies</code>
will tell you which version of Ruby you are using, and</p>

<p><code>rvm gemset show</code>
will tell you which gemset you are using.  I have a default rails 4
gemset, but want to make a new one for rails 4.1.</p>

<p><code>rvm gemset create rails-4-1</code>
should do the trick. View more at <a href="http://rvm.io/gemsets">the rvm gemset page</a></p>

<p>Now that you have rails installed (check which version with <code>rails
-v</code>), go ahead and create a new project. If you want to use Rspec
testing framework as opposed to the default test unit, make sure to add
this gem to your Gemfile:</p>

<p><code>&#39;rspec-rails&#39;</code> and then run <code>bundle install</code></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to install the postgresql gem (add to Gemfile: <code>&#39;pg&#39;</code>)and specify that as the database as well:</p>

<p><code>rails new myApp -d postgresl</code></p>

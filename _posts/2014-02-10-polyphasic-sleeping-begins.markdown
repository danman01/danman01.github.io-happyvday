###Captain's log: Day 1
*Monday, Feb 10th, 2:38am*

What fun is there in trying something like a backwards sleep cycle if
you're not going to keep a Captain's Log?

So here 'tis: 
I started the polyphasic sleep cycle about 24 hours ago, with
aspirations to align with the [uberman schedule]("http://www.polyphasicsociety.com/polyphasic-sleep/overviews/uberman-2/"). A few minutes ago, I found [this guide]("http://smartsleepteam.com/"), which has some getting used to napping advise.  In retrospect, that is good advice, as I wasn't able to fall asleep 2/3 naps I took.  I also only took 3 naps, because they were a little more [Every man]("http://www.puredoxyk.com/index.php/2007/01/24/six-months-on-everyman/") than uber man.

###List of sleeps taken during the first day:<br/>###

1. I took my first nap around 12:45AM, but don't believe I fell asleep.
   Around 1:30am my alarm whent off. It was quite a struggle to not call off the entire experiment and get a normal night's sleep. It was like being
offered a free bucket of KFC when you're trying to go vegetarian.  Somehow I
got up and started to read a book.  I turned on a few lights to simulate
daytime, and sat around for 30 minutes or so. Then I got up and worked / surfed on the cpu until the next nap, around 5:45am. I also made some homemade corn tortillas and guac to pass the time.  It was pretty cool having an extra few hours in the middle of the night to read / consume articles on polyphasic sleep / think about how tired I was going to be the next day.<br />

2. Nap two occured at 5:45am, and this is where I really slipped up.
   Instead of getting up at 6:20am or so, turns out I wanted to sleep till
9:20.  I'll be the first to admit, I'm a lazy sloth that should be put
in some sort of boot camp.  When I got up, I was full of energy. I
attempted a short ~ 10 minute meditation, and things felt normal. I got
up and finished the corn tortillas, which were the spoils of war against
sleep on that first night.<br />

3. Nap three was one of those naps that you crave all day at work /
   school.  Around 1:30pm, I had a deep power nap and woke up very
energized, and enthusiastic about the whole experiment.  Since I slept
so long that morning (core sleep), I figured I would hold off until
around 10pm for the next nap.  I had plenty of energy and took a bike
ride all the way to Olneyville to visit a mexican food mart I found on
Yelp.  The food mart was one of the dingiest places I've been in, ever.
The first can of kidney beans I picked up had a "best used by" date
ending in 2007! Still, I spoke some spanish and somehow came out of
there with ajo fresco, comina, canela, chili powder, and a few cans of
frijoles (was planning on making a chilé, which came out boss) <br /.>
4. Nap 4 was the last of the day, starting around 10:45. I didn't fall
   asleep however (maybe because the coffee I drank in between nap 3 and
4...?), and went through two rounds of pushing the alarm back, as I was
pretty determined to get some sort of sleep. I finally did, and awoke at
around 1am.
